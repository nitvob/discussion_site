# Discussion Site

## About

This project is a simple discussion site built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. The primary features include:

- **REST API**: Allows clients to create topics, add comments, and reply to existing comments.
- **Integration with MongoDB**: All data is stored in a Mongo cluster.
- **HTTP Requests**: The React frontend interacts with the backend using Axios for HTTP requests.
